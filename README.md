This is my own personal take on a Zelda wiki built using Express, my goal is to create a source of information on the games, including;

Dungeons, lore, maps, screenshots, videos, music, side-quests, items, & more!


The main page will have a navbar at the top with the site logo accompanied by dropdown menus for characters, and games to start. The front page will have a banner (maybe carousel style) of Breath of the Wild, with the main page linking to the breath of the wild page primarily.


There will be a 'character' page and a 'game' page used to neatly display different elements of information, I will have different layouts for each of them respectively.

After I add in a few character/game pages and get it functioning cleanly/looking nice, I will work on adding in different specific information pages, such as creating a 'dungeon' page, or a 'map' page (these are specialized, i will try to include maps of the world in the game pages)

I will also see if it is possible to add in some map functionality to show places that sell Breath of the Wild.
